        <e><b class="bd-fs">D</b></e>ue to Covid19, the elderly have been advised to stay indoors and keep social distancing. Because of this, 
        it created a sense of loneliness. They need to quickly learn how to become adept with video calling technologies in order to communicate with loved ones, 
        family and more. However, many found the technology currently available difficult to ones, they found that there was not enough support and that the experience felt very lonesome. 
        In fact, this population has a tendency to back off when things get "tricky" and have found that the bureaucratic wait time was also a big issue in these big video conferencing platforms offerings. 
        However, it was noted that 88% of the elderly are using the internet now. Which makes this problem very important to solve. How can these video chat platforms that aid in solving there sense of loneliness do better.

        Introducing SimpleTalk, a video/messaging App designed specifically for people 65 & over. It's simple and direct design allows the elderly to easily navigate through the app, find contacts and make calls. 
        The application has a simple messaging interface that provides clear messaging. There is a built-in AI assistant that can provide the user with any help in regards to navigating or using the app. 
        It also provides flashy news prompts/ suggest topics on the screen, during video calls, based on their interests, so that they can find things to talk about. 
        They are also taken care of from the start of the process by being told exactly where to click. They are also continuously shared with exactly what data the application has gathered from them in order to maintain transparency. 
        Many add-on features exist and. With an AI assistant chatbot that resembles the voice of a real human, family/friend based support and direct call support. 
        This creates the best experience for the elderly to not feel as alone with their relative. It removes the barrier of technology being so difficult to use.

            The first step before designing the UI/UX of any product is to understand the persons that will be using your product, 
            as it will allow the designer/developer to ensure a final product that will fulfill the needs and preferences of the user. 
            Especially in our case, where our user base, the elderly, is a group that is faced with many challenges with using modern technology in their day to day life, 
            it is of utmost importance that we understand our user completely to be able to produce something that will actually benefit them. So, we have decided to conduct our research through online surveys and interviews. 
            Since not all of the elderly population might be using social apps and the internet, we decided to conduct interviews to increase the quantity of our research subjects to ensure accuracy in understanding their needs.
